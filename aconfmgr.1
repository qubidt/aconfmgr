.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Output a usage message and exit.

.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-config " " \fIDIR\fR
Set the path to the configuration directory.

the \fBsave\fR command will write to, and
the \fBapply\fR command will read from, respectively.

See also \fBFILES\fR below.

.TP
.B \-\-skip-config
Skip the configuration parsing step, and reuse results from previous run.

.TP
.B \-\-skip-inspection
Skip the system inspection step, and reuse results from previous run.

.TP
.B \-\-skip-checksums
Skip the checksum verification of files belonging to installed packages.

When enabled, changes to a package's files are still detected through modification
time, size and other properties.

Enabling this option is generally safe and greatly speeds up execution speed,
but can fail to detect changes to a file's contents in exceptional circumstances,
such as filesystem corruption, intentional manipulation or badly behaved programs.

.TP
\fB\-\-aur-helper\fR \fIHELPER\fR
Set the AUR helper to use for installing foreign packages.

Supported values are
.BR aurman ", " pacaur ", " yaourt ", " yay ", and " makepkg
(for which \fBaconfmgr\fR will download, resolve dependencies, and build/install itself).

.TP
\fB\-\-color\fR \fIWHEN\fR
When to use colors in output
.RB ( always / auto / never ).

If set, it is propagated appropriately to invoked programs.

.TP

The default is to not prompt when executed commands would themselves show a prompt before performing changes.

This option is mutually exclusive with \fB\-\-yes\fR.

If set, it is propagated appropriately to invoked programs.
